## coverageHMM.pkl was generated with hmmlearn.ipynb by training on read coverage data across several highly expressed RNAs.

It is used in normalizaSHAPE.py to categorize regions into covered or not covered, for the purpose of dealing with the artifact of
RT-stop based structure probing that mistakes some regions with no coverage as having no reactivity.
i.e. no coverage should produce a reactivity value of NaN, not 0.

Requires hmmlearn, joblib, and numpy packages

Note: joblib is its own package, imported with the usual "import joblib", however, for scikit-learn<0.21 joblib is imported with "from sklearn.externals import joblib".

It may be necessary to replace coverageHMM.pkl with coverageHMM_old.pkl if your sklearn is out of date, and to uncomment the line
"from sklearn.externals import joblib" at the top of normalizeSHAPE.py and comment out "import joblib".
